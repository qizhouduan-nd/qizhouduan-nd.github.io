<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<div class="p1">
    I a Ph.D. candiate in quantitative psychology, and a fellow under the <a href = "https://iei.nd.edu/initiatives/pier">ND PIER program</a> 
    (Program for interdisciplinary educational research).  
    My research mainly focuses on response time models in the context of psychometric analysis, 
    looking for ways to utilize response time to either improve parameter esitmation or to detect item biases. 
    Besides response time models, I am interested in both conducting meta-analysis, and methodologies related to meta-analysis. 
    I also have substantive interests in clinical and cognitive research. 
    I can be reached at my email: qduan@nd.edu, and you can find my CV <a href = "cv_qizhou.pdf" >here</a>.
