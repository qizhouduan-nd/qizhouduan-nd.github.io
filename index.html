<h1> Qizhou Duan </h1>
<p> I am Qizhou Duan, a third-year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology. I am also a fellow under the <a href = "https://iei.nd.edu/initiatives/pier">ND PIER program</a> (Program for interdisciplinary educational research). My research is mainly about bringing response time models and item response theory together and looking for ways to connect psychometrics and cognitive psychology. Recently, I have been working on using non-parametric techniques to detect item biases. </p>

<p> Before joining  <a href = "https://psychology.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame Psychology</a>, I was an undergrad at <a href = "https://www.wm.edu/"> The College of William and Mary</a> studying Mathematics and Psychology. In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer and chess -- you are welcome to challenge me on <a href ="https://chess.com">chess.com</a>, my username is typeIerror; I can be reached at my email: qduan@nd.edu. </p>
