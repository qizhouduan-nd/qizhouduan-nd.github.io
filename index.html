<h1> Qizhou Duan </h1>
<p> I am Qizhou Duan, a third-year Ph.D. student in quantitative psychology. I am also a fellow under the ND PIER program (Program for interdisciplinary educational research). My research is mainly about bringing response time models and item response theory together and looking for ways to connect psychometric measurement and cognitive psychology. Recently, I have been working on using non-parametric techniques to detect item biases, and I need to work on a real data set to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new techniques. </p>

<p> Before joining  <a href = "https://psychology.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame Psychology</a>, I was an undergrad at <a href = "www.wm.edu"> The College of William and Mary </a> studying Mathematics and Psychology. In my spare time, I enjoy play soccer and chess -- you are welcome to challenge me on <a href "chess.com"> chess.com </a>, my username is typeIerror; I can be reached at my email: qduan@nd.edu. </p>
